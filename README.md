# Resume-Word-Clusters

This project runs with the dataset (as described below) to identify common words/skills that can be used in a resume for a particular field to increase an individuals chances of getting hired. This project was decided to optimized an individuals resume based on their identified industry of interest. The project involes dataset preprocessing, feature selelction, word processing and the use of clustering to identify these keywords.

The dataset was obtained from Kaggle: Predicting Job Titles from Resumes (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/predicting-job-titles-from-resumes)

The clustering concludes with seven clusters indicating somewhat of a hierarchical clustering for those three clusters. The identified job sectors: administration, engineering, services and operations, processes, cooperate business, finances, and information technology can now be accessed to provide information on the best words for job seekers to include in their resumes to better cater to their sector of interest and possibly increase their chances of getting hired.
